            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>As Mentioned on the home page my name is Braden R. I am 20 years old and have been interested in electric skateboarding (eSkating) since I was almost 17. I first found out about eSkating from my friend Hunter who got an electric skateboard for Christmas one year and when I went to visit him a few months later I got to try it for the first time. I instantly fell in love with it and quickly thought about getting my own. A few months later I finally decided to get my own and bought the Spadger D5X Plus which I rode around for a few weeks before it ended up breaking on me. Extremely disappointed in having now wasted about $500 I returned it and got my money back. In hindsight it was kind of good that that happened as that company no longer sells that board and finding information on the company is difficult. A few months passed and I had mostly moved on from losing the board but some resentment still stuck around. At this point I ended up visiting Hunter again and got to ride his longboard. Doing so made me want to get an eSkate again. Both of us ended up eyeing the Skatebolt Breeze II and about a year later Hunter ended up buying it as an important wheel screw sheared and it was unsafe to ride his board. On another visit I ended up getting to ride the Breeze and I loved it, about a week later I bought one for myself. Then it arrived a few weeks later. Part of the reason I decided to buy it was because I was graduating soon and leaving for college later that year. Having been to the campus I knew that having an eSkate would be useful for getting around quickly and easily.</p>

            <h3>Once the Breeze arrived</h3>
            <p>As soon as the new board arrived I plugged it in and started to charge it so I could ride it. After a while of waiting for it to charge, I unplugged it before fully charging it so I could ride it earlier as it was going to be dark soon. I took the board outside into the neighborhood street and started to ride it around. Having ridden an eSkate before I was already confident on how to ride and so I went down to the longest street in the neighborhood to try and hit top speed. Due to my impatience however I didn't put enough thought into how the board was set up. The trucks ended up being too loose for what I was used to at or near full speed (30mph). Once I reached speed I ended up getting speed wobbles. Unable to regain control of the board it shot out to the right and I didn't follow it.</p>

            <h3>Getting Injured</h3>
            <p>After getting the wobbles and now falling without a way to roll I ended up landing on the back of my shoulder, whipping my head into the concrete. Thankfully I was wearing a helmet that saved me from possibly dying or at least getting a concussion. As I hit the ground I remember thinking how hard I hit my head and that I was glad to have the helmet on. Immediately after stopping I stood back up and looked down to see that my arm now had a section of it covered in road rash, and that my hands were a bit scraped up. Getting back on the board to get home I rode it to the bottom of the hill my house is on and proceeded to get off and jog up the hill. Getting inside and taking off my shirt to see the extent of my road rash I notice that my collarbone area doesn't look the same on each side of me. A quick trip to the ER and an X-ray confirming that I broke my collarbone. My first ever bone break.</p>

            <h3>The Following Day</h3>
            <p>The next day I was quite tired from not sleeping well as I had to sleep flat on my back and not move so the bone could heal properly. But now being the next day I needed to get cleaned up somehow, so I ended up getting a bath from my mother. Most of the time was spent by my mother picking out gauze that had glued to my skin from the little healing that had happened overnight. But afterwards I was able to go about my day mostly like normal but mostly without using my left arm.</p>

            <h3>The Following Months</h3>
            <p>Having fallen in late July it wasn't until mid september that I was able to finally stop wearing a sling as my bone was mostly healed and I could go back to using it for the most part. At this point I was just starting my first semester of college and was finally able to start riding again. It took a lot of time to get comfortable at speed as I was still worried about falling again. After a few months of riding however I got used to riding fast again and was more comfortable as a whole.</p>

            <h3>Today</h3>
            <p>Nowadays riding on my Tynee Explorer I am more comfortable than I have ever been before, with better tires for the terrain and stronger motors I often cruise at speeds that I would only ever touch for a second or two on the Breeze or not at all. Having learned many lessons from many falls and slides I have become more confident and safer as a whole. I believe that anyone can get to the point where I am and even more so, all it takes is some dedication and time.</p>
